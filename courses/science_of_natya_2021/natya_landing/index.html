    <p class="large2 w3-justify">
      The Nāṭyaśāstra lays the foundation for the grammar and aesthetics of all performing arts of India, the classical theatre in particular. A thorough study of the text can benefit a poet, musician, dancer, sculptor, painter, theatre artist, art critic and an aesthetician.
